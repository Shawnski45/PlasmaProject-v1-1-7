# PlasmaProject E-Commerce MVP – Week 1 Readiness Report

## 1. File Structure & Models
- All required files and directories are present (`run.py`, `app/__init__.py`, `app/models/user.py`, `order.py`, `upload.py`, `app/utils/costing.py`, `app/utils/dxf_parser.py`, `requirements.txt`, and docs).
- Models in `app/models/` use MongoDB (`pymongo`), with no SQLAlchemy/SQL references remaining.

## 2. Dependencies
- `requirements.txt` includes both `pymongo` and `firebase-admin` (using `>=` instead of `==` for versions).
- All other expected dependencies for Flask, Stripe, and utilities are present.

## 3. MongoDB Atlas Setup
- `app/__init__.py` connects to MongoDB Atlas using `MONGODB_URI` from environment variables.
- The MongoDB client and database are properly initialized.

## 4. Firebase Authentication Setup
- Firebase is initialized with credentials loaded from environment variables in `app/__init__.py`.
- Uses `firebase-admin` for authentication.

## 5. Preservation of Core Logic
- `app/utils/costing.py` and `app/utils/dxf_parser.py` are present, unchanged, and functional.
- No signs of accidental modifications or regressions.

## 6. Local Testing & Error Log Review
- The server starts successfully (`run.py`).
- No critical errors or stack traces in the `error.log` (last 100 lines show only normal INFO logs: server startup, blueprint registration, upload folder checks, and HTTP requests).
- No exceptions, tracebacks, or warnings related to MongoDB, Firebase, or DXF parsing observed.
- DXF upload and core quoting logic appear to be working, as no related errors are logged.

## 7. Blockers & Recommendations
- **No critical blockers detected.** All Week 1 requirements are met and the system is stable.
- **Minor recommendation:** Pin `pymongo` and `firebase-admin` versions in `requirements.txt` to `==4.8.0` and `==6.5.0` for full reproducibility.
- **Security reminder:** The log warns that the Flask server is in development mode. For production, use a WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn or uWSGI).

## Summary Table: Week 1 Tasks

|------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| MongoDB Atlas setup                | Complete          | Connected via `pymongo` in `app/__init__.py`   |

| Model migration to MongoDB         | Complete          | All models use `pymongo`, no SQL references    |
| Core logic preservation            | Complete          | `costing.py` and `dxf_parser.py` unchanged     |
| All required files/directories     | Complete          | Structure matches plan                         |
| Dependency versions                | Partially Complete| Present, but not pinned to exact versions      |
| Local testing                      | Complete          | Server runs, no critical errors in log         |

## Are you ready for Week 2?

**YES** – You are ready to begin Week 2 (Stripe payment integration and related tasks).

## Next Steps

1. **(Optional but Recommended):** Pin `pymongo` and `firebase-admin` versions in `requirements.txt`.
2. Proceed to Week 2 tasks:
   - Add Stripe integration (`routes/payments.py`, update `checkout.html`, webhook handler, etc.).
   - Continue to test each new feature locally and log any new errors.

**If you have any specific errors, unexpected behavior, or want to verify a particular feature, let me know before we move to Week 2!**
