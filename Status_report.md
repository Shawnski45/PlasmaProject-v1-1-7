Updated functional alignment with Grok from 7-7-25
Thank you for the clarifications! I appreciate the insights into your preferences, and I’ll adjust the plan accordingly. Let’s refine the intended functionality based on your feedback and outline the next steps to align the application with your vision.

### Updated Functional Alignment
#### Must-Have: Parsing and Preview
- **Intended**: Parse each uploaded DXF file as a unique `OrderItem` and display its preview immediately.
- **Current**: Works as intended with unique `OrderItem` creation per upload.
- **Action**: Preserve this. No deduplication—allow multiple uploads of the same DXF file as separate items, letting the user manually remove duplicates if needed.

#### Cart Responsiveness
- **Intended**: Allow adding/removing parts, changing materials/thicknesses, and persisting fields without errors or interference. If a material change invalidates thickness options, reset thickness to null gracefully on the client side. Each upload creates a unique cart item.
- **Current**: Adding works (duplicates allowed), removing fails due to recalculation, and material/thickness changes trigger errors via `/update_price`.
- **Action**: 
  - Keep current upload behavior (no deduplication).
  - Fix `remove` to avoid recalculation until "Calculate".
  - Remove `/update_price` and its calls, handling material/thickness changes client-side with null reset and visual feedback (red field) if invalid.

#### Calculate Button
- **Intended**: Enable "Calculate" when the cart exists (no field validation pre-click). On click, perform pricing and validate all items. If any required field (material, thickness) is missing or invalid, show a polite popup with specific guidance (e.g., "Please select a material for part X"), highlight the offending field in red, and prevent price display until corrected.
- **Current**: "Calculate" visibility works, but 500 errors from `/update_price` disrupt flow.
- **Action**: 
  - Remove `/update_price` reliance.
  - Add a `/calculate` endpoint to handle pricing and validation on click.
  - Implement client-side validation with red highlighting and a popup, ensuring material selection errors are explicit.

#### Pricing Separation
- **Intended**: Defer to a separate `pricing.py` file later.
- **Current**: In `main.py`.
- **Action**: Keep in `main.py` for now; plan extraction post-UX stabilization.

#### Payment (Stripe)
- **Intended**: Use Stripe for payment, confirming orders post-payment.
- **Current**: Placeholder in `/guest_checkout`.
- **Action**: Defer until core UX is solid.

#### Guest vs. Returning User Experiences
- **Intended**: Prioritize guest UX (zero barriers, clear instructions). Anticipate returning user features.
- **Current**: Guest-focused.
- **Action**: Continue prioritizing guest UX; note user model for future.

#### File Storage for Production
- **Intended**: Save DXF files for production access post-purchase.
- **Current**: Files are saved to `UPLOAD_FOLDER`.
- **Action**: Ensure persistence; link to orders after payment.

### Revised Plan
1. **Preserve Unique Uploads**:
   - No deduplication logic; each DXF upload creates a new `OrderItem`.
   - **Goal**: Support multiple identical uploads for different material/thickness combinations.

2. **Remove Dynamic Updates**:
   - Delete `/update_price` endpoint and `updateCartItem` JavaScript.
   - Update `customer_index.html` to handle material/thickness changes client-side:
     - Reset thickness to null if the new material lacks the previous thickness.
     - Highlight invalid fields (e.g., empty material) in red with a popup (e.g., "Please select a material for part X").
   - **Goal**: Error-free cart manipulation until "Calculate".

3. **Fix Remove Functionality**:
   - Modify `/remove` to delete `OrderItem` without recalculation until "Calculate".
   - **Goal**: Successful removal without errors.

4. **Implement Calculate Endpoint**:
   - Add `/calculate` in `main.py` to perform pricing and validation on click.
   - Use `load_inputs` and `recalculate_cart`, skipping items with `material=None` or invalid thickness, and return errors for the frontend to display.
   - **Goal**: Pricing on demand with clear validation feedback.

5. **Preserve Parsing and Preview**:
   - Keep `/` and `/preview_data` unchanged.
   - **Goal**: Maintain core UX reliability.

6. **Defer Pricing Separation and Stripe**:
   - Keep pricing in `main.py`; defer `pricing.py` and Stripe.
   - **Goal**: Focus on current priorities.

7. **Anticipate Returning User and File Storage**:
   - Note user model and file linkage for future.
   - **Goal**: Prepare architecture.

### Current Problems to Address
- **Remove Errors**: Fix `/remove` to avoid recalculation.
- **Update Price Errors**: Remove `/update_price` and its calls.
- **Validation Feedback**: Add client-side handling with red fields and popups.

### Next Steps
1. **Confirm Approach**:
   - Agree on client-side validation (red fields, popup) instead of server-side pre-calculation.
   - Confirm skipping `material=None` in `/calculate` is acceptable, with popup feedback.

2. **Update `main.py`**:
   - Remove `/update_price`.
   - Fix `/remove` to skip recalculation.
   - Add `/calculate` with validation logic.

3. **Update `customer_index.html`**:
   - Remove `updateCartItem` and `/update_price` calls.
   - Add client-side material/thickness handling with red highlighting and popup.

Please confirm if the client-side validation approach (red fields, popup) and skipping `material=None` in `/calculate` align with your vision. Once confirmed, I’ll provide the updated code for `main.py` and `customer_index.html`.
